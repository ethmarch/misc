# Testing the Friendship Paradox with Facebook

The friendship paradox is the phenomenon first observed by the sociologist Scott L. Feld in 1991 that most people have fewer friends than their friends have, on average. 

Explanation: This is a form of sampling bias in which people with greater numbers of friends have an increased likelihood of being observed among one's own friends.

In this notebook I demonstrate this phenomenon using data gathered from my and some of my friends Facebook profiles.
