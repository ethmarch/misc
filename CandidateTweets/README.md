# Exploring Candidate Tweets

This is a small project I did as an introduction to the Twitter API and it's wrapper for Python Tweepy.
The *candidatescursor.py* file is what I used to scrape the data.  Then the *PresCanTweets* notebook contains
some word frequency analysis and basic matplotlib visualizations.
